# Terms of Service

The following terms and conditions ("Terms") govern all use of any Orycion service and all content and products available at or through the service, including, but not limited to, Orycion Website ("Orycion"), Healthy Gym ("Healthy Gym"), and Healthy Abs ("Healthy Abs"), (taken together, our "Services"). Our Services are offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, [Orycion's Privacy Policy](https://www.orycion.com/privacy)) and procedures that may be published from time to time by Orycion (collectively, the "Agreement"). You agree that we may automatically upgrade our Services, and these Terms will apply to any upgrades.

Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our Services, you agree to become bound by the Terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree to all the Terms of this Agreement, then you may not access or use any of our Services. If these Terms are considered an offer by Orycion, acceptance is expressly limited to these Terms. We may modify the Agreement from time to time. Please read the Agreement and check back often. If you do not agree to any change to the Agreement then you must immediately stop using the Service.

Our Services are not directed to children. Access to and use of our Services is only for those over the age of 13 (or 16 in the European Union). If you are younger than this, you may not register for or use our Services. Any person who registers as a user or provides their personal information to our Services represents that they are 13 years of age or older (16 years or older in the European Union).

Use of our Services may require an account, for example a Healthy Account. You agree to provide us with complete and accurate information when you register for an account. You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your username. You are responsible for keeping your password secure.

### 1. Profile

*   **Your Profile.** If you create a profile in any of our Services, you must not engage in “username squatting”, claim an unreasonable number of usernames (as determined by us), or sell access to any usernames. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and profile, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with the profile. You must immediately notify Orycion of any unauthorised uses of your profile, your account, or any other breaches of security. Orycion will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.
*   **Responsibility of Contributors.** If you operate a profile, comment on a profile, post material to a Orycion Service, post links in an Orycion Service, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available (any such material, "Content"), you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content or your conduct. That is the case regardless of what form the Content takes, which includes, but is not limited to text, photo, video, audio, or code. By using an Orycion Service, you represent and warrant that your Content and conduct do not violate these Terms. By submitting Content to Orycion for inclusion on your profile, you grant Orycion a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing, and promoting your profile. This license allows Orycion to make publicly-posted content available to third parties selected by Orycion so that these third parties can analyze and distribute (but not publicly display) your content through their services. If you delete Content, Orycion will use reasonable efforts to remove it from the Service, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, Orycion has the right (though not the obligation) to, in Orycion’s sole discretion, (i) reclaim your username or profile's URL due to prolonged inactivity, (ii) refuse or remove any content that, in Orycion’s reasonable opinion, violates any Orycion policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (iii) terminate or deny access to and use of a Service to any individual or entity for any reason. Orycion will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.
*   **Advertisements.** Orycion reserves the right to display advertisements on your profile and/or Service unless you have paid for a plan that includes the removal of ads.
*   **Attribution.** Orycion reserves the right to display attribution text or links in your profile footer or toolbar, attributing Orycion, for example.

### 2. Responsibility of Visitors.

We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material (such as computer software, items for sale, or content) posted to our Services by users or anyone else (“Site Materials”), and are not responsible for any Site Materials’ content, use, or effects. We do not endorse any Site Materials or represent that Site Materials are accurate, useful, or non-harmful. We also disclaim any responsibility for any harm resulting from anyone’s use, purchase or downloading of Site Materials. If you access or use any Site Materials, you are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. Site Materials may be offensive, indecent, objectionable, or include technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors, or violate or infringe the privacy or publicity rights, intellectual property rights, (see section below to submit copyright complaints) and other proprietary rights, of third parties. Any Site Materials offered for sale through any of our Services are the seller’s sole responsibility, and you agree that you will look solely to the seller for any damages that result from your purchase or use of Site Materials. We are not a party to, and will have no responsibility or liability for, any communications, transactions, interactions, or disputes, between you and the provider of any Site Materials. Last thing: Please note that additional terms and conditions may apply to the downloading, copying, purchase, or use of Site Materials.

### 3. Fees, Payment, and Renewal.

*   **Fees.** Some of our Services are offered for a fee, while other Services may be free with optional paid upgrades, such as a Healthy Gym plan ("Paid Services"). By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees. Depending on the Paid Service, there may be a one-time fee or recurring fees. For recurring fees, we'll bill or charge you for in regular intervals (such as monthly, annually, or biennially), on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time by contacting the relevant support team.
*   **Taxes.** To the extent permitted by law, or unless explicitly stated otherwise, all fees are exclusive of applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, goods and services, harmonised or other taxes, fees or charges now in force or enacted in the future (“Taxes”). You are responsible for payment of all applicable Taxes relating to your use of our Services, your payments, or your purchases. If we are obligated to pay or collect Taxes on the Fees you've paid or will pay, you are responsible for such Taxes, and we may collect payment for such Taxes.
*   **Payment.** If your payment fails or Paid Services are otherwise not paid for on time, we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to the Paid Services. If you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services, we may revoke your access to our Services in general.
*   **Automatic Renewal.** To ensure uninterrupted service, recurring Paid Services are automatically renewed. This means that unless you cancel a Paid Service before the end of the applicable subscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorise us to invoice you or use any payment mechanism we have on record for you to collect the then-applicable subscription fee (as well as any Taxes). Your Paid Services are renewed for the same interval of time. For example, if you purchase a Healthy Gym annual plan, you will be charged each year.
*   **Refunds.** While you may cancel a Paid Service at any time, refunds are issued in our sole discretion.
*   **Fee Changes.** We may change our fees at any time. When applicable, we may give you advance notice of the fee changes. If you don't agree with the fee changes, you can cancel your Paid Service.

### 4. Content Posted on Other Websites.

We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, made available through the websites and webpages to which a Service links, and that link to a Service. Orycion does not have any control over those non-Service websites, and is not responsible for their contents or their use. By linking to a non-Service website, Orycion does not represent or imply that it endorses such website. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. Orycion disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from your use of non-WordPress.com websites and webpages.

### 5. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy.

As Orycion asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that material located on or linked to by an Orycion Service violates your copyright, you are encouraged to notify Orycion. Orycion will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material. Orycion will terminate a visitor's access to and use of the website if, under appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of Orycion or others. In the case of such termination, Orycion will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to Orycion.

### 6. Intellectual Property.
